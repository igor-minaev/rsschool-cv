### About Myself:

I have been working as an electrician for a long time. And now I am no longer developing as a specialist in this area, but I am very interested in learning something new. Frontend development interested me the most because it is an opportunity to create something that is tonal and useful for people, and even during development, I can immediately see the finished result. This is why I am here.
